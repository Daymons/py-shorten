# [py-shorten](https://short.cvillahro.live), a lightweight Python URL shortener. 
Made using Flask and a SQLite3 database, the program is capable of serving a URL shortener to everyone. It's very lightweight and made to run on any kind of server (even on a free EC2 instance).

# How do I run it?
You only need to clone the repository (``git clone https://github.com/Daymons/py-shorten``) if you have the Git tool installed, else just download it from that page),   
[install Python if you havent already](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the required libraries with ``pip -i requirements.txt``.   
Then, you'll only need to change the ``base_url`` variable, located at the top of the program, to match the domain you have, and you'll be ready to go!
